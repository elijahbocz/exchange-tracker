The Coin Exchange Tracker allows you to view all of their crypto purchases in one place.

With no real connections to any exchange, the data you put into your account will pose no risk to your holdings.

Instead, this website is available to quickly track all of your purchases across the different exchanges you've used for purchasing cryptocurrency, and calculating the profits and losses across them all based off of the current prices.

Coin Exchange Tracker is built with Python, React, and MySQL.
